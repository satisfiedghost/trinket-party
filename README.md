# trinket-party
Party in a box on an ATtiny85.

ISR driven project to play some music, flash some LEDs, and cram more stuff into the ATtiny85 than I should. Ultimately to be housed in an Altoid's tin. Makes a great gift.

TODO:

* ~~Create Servo Driver~~
* Interesting LED routines
* Please please please get off Ardiuno IDE
* Better songs.
* General cleanup.
